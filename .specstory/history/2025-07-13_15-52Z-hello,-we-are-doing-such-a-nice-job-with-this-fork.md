Hello, we are doing such a nice job with this fork. I think its time to start implementing a connection with a chatbot in the Help Menu. This will open a chatbot conversation in the right side of the screen. This bot will connect to openrouter. We need to plan this to try to bring to our fork something already developed, functional and compatible with our app.
Get all the documentation and research you need to provide me options for this implementation.
